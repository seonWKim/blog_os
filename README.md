- To write an OS, we need code that doesn't depend on any OS features
    - e.g. threads, files, heap memory, network, random numbers, standard output that requires any other
      features requiring OS abstractions or specific hardware
- What can we benefit from Rust when writing OS?
    - Surely, not the OS related features but, we still have
        - iterators
        - closures
        - pattern matching
        - option, result
        - string formatting
        - ownership
    - We need "freestanding" or "bare-metal" executable which doesn't depend on the underlying OS
- By default, Rust crates link the standard lib, which depends on the OS for features such as 
  - threads, files, or networking
  - `libc`, which is the C standard library, which closely interacts with OS services
